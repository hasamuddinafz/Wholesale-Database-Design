# Database Project README

This README provides an overview of the requirements, tasks, and expectations for the database project assigned to student groups. The project focuses on designing and implementing a database system, which includes various stages from conceptualization to implementation using SQL and APEX.

## Project Overview

### 1. Scenario Detail
- Understand and define the scenario provided for the database project.

### 2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Define at least 7 entities relevant to the scenario.
- Specify attributes for each entity.
- Establish necessary relationships using a matrix diagram.
- Consider super-type/subtype relationships, arc and hierarchical structures, and non-transferable relationships where applicable.

### 3. Table Instance Chart
- Prepare a table instance chart that maps the entities and their relationships from the ERD to the database structure.

### 4. SQL DDL Statements
- Write SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to implement the ERD:
  - Create tables.
  - Define constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
  - Ensure table relationships are reflected accurately.

### 5. Physical Database Creation
- Use APEX to create the physical database based on the designed ERD and SQL DDL statements.

### 6. Data Entry
- Populate the database with relevant data as per the scenario requirements.

### 7. SQL DML Statements
- Write SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements to retrieve information:
  - One statement including a subquery.
  - One statement including a join operation.
  - One statement including a `GROUP BY` clause.
  - One statement including a date function.
  - One statement including a character function.
  - One statement including an `UPDATE` statement.
  - One statement including an `ALTER TABLE` statement.

## Project Guidelines and Assessment

- **Project Evaluation**: The project is worth 100 points and constitutes 15% of the total grade.
- **Group Collaboration**: Students are required to work on the project in groups.
- **Scenario Assignment**: Each group has a specific scenario number assigned, which can be found in the shared group Excel file.
- **Presentation**: Groups will present their projects using their own computers. Questions related to the project may be asked during the presentation.
- **Academic Integrity**: Projects with identical designs and implementations will result in reduced final exam scores for the students involved.

## Submission

- **Deadline**: The completed project must be uploaded to Teams before the due date specified.
